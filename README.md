# Random Quote Machine

First created the Random Quote Machine with jQuery as one of the FreeCodeCamp 5 projects to earn the Front End Development Libraries Certificate. Recreated this improved version as a side project using React (Hooks) and standardised the UI for aesthetic and webpage-responsiveness (a mobile-first-approach).
