# Random Quote Machine

I first created the Random Quote Machine with jQuery as the first of the FreeCodeCamp 5 projects to earn the Front End Development Libraries. I have recreated this improved version as a side project using React (Hook) and standardised the UI for aesthetic and responsiveness, a mobile-first-approach to web development.

## Tech Stack 

React Hooks 
React-fontawesome
GitHub API for quotes 
Node.js
